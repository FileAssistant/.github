## ‚ùì What is FileAssistant?

**FileAssistant** centralizes everyday file operations‚Äîcopy, move, compare, sync, archive‚Äîinto a single, fast, keyboard-friendly app. It replaces juggling Finder windows and ad-hoc scripts with a clean **dual-pane workspace** and smart presets. Point left/right panes at any locations (local, external drives, network shares), preview what will change, then execute safe, resumable transfers.

Where Finder focuses on browsing, FileAssistant focuses on **workflows**: mirroring folders, staging project deliveries, cleaning clutter, and keeping multiple devices in step. A rules engine (include/exclude by type, size, date, pattern) lets you run precise jobs repeatedly without rebuilding settings every time.

---

## üß† Deep Dive: How It Works

- **Sync Engine** ‚Äî Choose Mirror, Update, Two-Way, or Custom. The preview shows creates/updates/deletes before running. Jobs can be saved as reusable recipes with schedules.  
- **Power Tools** ‚Äî Bulk rename with tokens, create archives (ZIP/7z), verify integrity via **MD5/SHA** checksums, split big files, join parts, and set file attributes in batches.  
- **Library Hygiene** ‚Äî Find duplicates and large files, group by type/size/age, and archive or delete safely with an undo window.  
- **Search & Filters** ‚Äî Lightning search with regex and attribute filters across both panes; store favorite queries.  
- **Safety First** ‚Äî Optional confirmations, conflict resolution rules, versioned copies, and skip lists prevent accidents.
